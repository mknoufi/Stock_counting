# Contributing to MCP servers

This repository maintains a curated collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for developer tools and services.

## What we're looking for

Accepted MCP servers provide value to developers:

- Version control systems, code review tools, and CI/CD platforms
- Cloud hosting, deployment, and infrastructure management services
- Databases and data analytics platforms
- API documentation, testing, and monitoring tools
- Security scanners and authentication services
- Issue tracking and project collaboration platforms
- Knowledge bases, wikis, and documentation generators

## How to contribute

### Request a server

- Submit MCP servers via the [Server Request Template](https://github.com/cursor/mcp-servers/issues/new?template=server-request.yml). All technical integration and testing is handled for you.
- This collection is curated. Servers must be useful to developers and work with professional development tools.
- To help prioritize what gets added next, upvote existing requests.
- By completing MCP onboarding, you grant us the right to display your company’s name and logo for identification and promotional purposes across our platform and materials

## Requirements

- Valid MCP server with proper protocol implementation
- Actively maintained and publicly available
- Clear installation and usage documentation
- Solves real development problems
- Professional presentation and reliable implementation

## What we don't accept

- Personal projects without broad appeal
- Submissions not relevant to developers or professional development workflows
- Consumer-focused applications
- Duplicates of existing servers

## Review process

1. Review against criteria
2. Test functionality
3. Add to collection

We process requests as fast as possible, but can't promise any timeline.
